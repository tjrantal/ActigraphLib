# ActigraphLib
ActigraphLib

Forked the code from https://github.com/jbrond/ActigraphLib/blob/master/Gt3xFile.java on the 1 October 2015.

I intend to use the reader through matlab to read acceleration data from the log.bin files, and info.txt files contained in actigraph .gt3x files.
I pre-extracted those files  from the .gt3x with 7-zip (to save time during analysis).
