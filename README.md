ActigraphLib

Forked the code from https://github.com/jbrond/ActigraphLib/blob/master/Gt3xFile.java on the 1 October 2015.

Modified the code to create a class to extract the [activity|log].bin and the info.txt from the .gt3x zip file com.video4coach.DecompressGT3x
com.video4coach.LogBinFileReader is to be used subsequently to dumb the accelerations to a .bin file (LE int16 format).
